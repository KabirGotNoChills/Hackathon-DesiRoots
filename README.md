🎨 Tribal Art Marketplace - Complete Digital Ecosystem for Cultural Preservation
Bridging Ancient Heritage with Modern Technology

A comprehensive, full-stack e-commerce platform specifically designed to preserve, promote, and monetize India's rich tribal art heritage while directly empowering indigenous artisans through digital transformation and sustainable economic opportunities.

🌍 PROJECT VISION & MISSION
Vision: To become India's premier digital gateway for authentic tribal art, ensuring no traditional craft disappears due to lack of market access or cultural disconnect.

Mission: Democratize tribal art commerce by eliminating intermediaries, preserving cultural knowledge through digital documentation, and creating sustainable livelihoods for indigenous communities across India.

No standardized pricing leading to exploitation
